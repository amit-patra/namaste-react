● - What is `NPM`?
Ans: Bundlers are packages. If we want to use a package in our
   code, we have to use a package manager.
   We use a package manager known as npm or yarn
   (NPM is a package manager used to install, delete, and update Javascript packages on your machine. )

Parcel features at a glance:
   -Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
   -File Watcher Algorithm - C++
   -Bundling
   -Minify Code
   -Cleaning our code
   -Dev and production build
   -Super fast build algorithm
   -Image Optimization
   -Caching while development
   -Compression
   -Compatible with older browser versions
   -Https on dev
   -Image Optimization
   -Port No
   -Consistency Hashing Algorithm
   -Zero Config
   -Tree Shaking

● - What is `.parcel-cache`
Ans: 
    -Parcel caches code all the time.
    -When we run the application, a build is created which takes some time in ms.
    -If we make any code changes and save the application, another
    build will be triggered which might take even less time than
    the previous build.
    -This reduction of time is due to parcel cache.
    -Parcel immediately loads the code from the cache every time there is a subsequent build.
    -On the very first build parcel creates a folder .parcel-cache where it stores the caches in binary codeformat.
    -Parcel gives faster build, faster developer experience because of caching.

● - What is `npx` ?
Ans: NPX is a package executer, and it is used to execute javascript packages directly, without installing them.
